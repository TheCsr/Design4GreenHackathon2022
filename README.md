#Topic made by the INR (Institut du Numérique Responsable)
Context
One of the objectives of the "training and skills" working group managed by the Institut du
Numérique Responsable has been to identify sustainable digital trainings.
Subject
Firstly, you must propose an accessible web page (RGAA - French Accessibility Guidelines), which
enable the web page visitors to visualize the trainings under two forms, a cartography and a list.
The teams will have to propose filters and a search engine to update the mapping and the list. You can
draw inspiration from the https://www.villes-internet.net/atlaas.
Secondly, you will need to allow an user to select the training courses he or she wishes to attend via
a shopping basket. For the purposes of the evaluation, we will select between 1 and 3 courses in the
basket. The user will be able to delete a course from the basket. The teams will have to allow the user
to automatically send an email to request a quote for the courses selected in the basket.
The export of these courses must be in a PDF or Excel format, directly usable. (no csv file)
In summary, the teams will have to create an accessible (RGGA) website with 1 page only, allowing:
• A presentation of sustainable digital trainings on one page in a cartographic and a list form
• The installation of a search engine / filters at the top of the page to find the training courses
of interest (region, keyword, training organization, skills, etc.) with an update of the map and
the list
• The creation of a training list and its export in PDF or Excel format
• The possibility of sending a request for a quote by e-mail

Documents provided
1. Csv file of the trainings and their tags
